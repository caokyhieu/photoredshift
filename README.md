## This repo contains implementation of some sampling methods : MCMC (Gibbs or Metropolis), rejected sampling and ABC sampling for posterior distribution. 


* I try to implement them when reading the book `Bayesian data analysis` of Gelman et al. Maybe it can have some mistake in the code. Any feedback is appreciated.

* Meanwhile, I used abstract class to helps the code can be easily maintance. You can modify it for your own sampler and customize the algorithm.
